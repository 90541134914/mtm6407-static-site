Welcome to My Website ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Unish â€“ a 21-year-old tech enthusiast, creative thinker, and sports lover.

This is my personal space on the web where I share who I am, the work Iâ€™ve done, and the things I love. Whether itâ€™s developing apps, exploring new tech tools, or expressing creativity through photography and music, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to grow and challenge myself.

What I Do ðŸŽ¯
Web Development â€“ I build simple and clean web apps using modern frameworks like Vue.js and static site generators like Jekyll.

Creative Projects â€“ From designing mock campaigns to building digital portfolios, I enjoy blending technology with creativity.

Learning & Exploring â€“ Iâ€™m always curious about new trends in tech, media, and design, and I love trying out new tools and ideas.

Featured Projects ðŸ’¡
Contact Book App (Vue.js) â€“ A user-friendly app to manage contacts using local storage.

Static Site with Jekyll â€“ A fully responsive personal interest website built with a static site generator.

Viral Campaign Simulation â€“ A mock marketing campaign created for a class project, featuring social media strategy and creative content.

Get to Know Me ðŸŽ¸
Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, playing the guitar, and staying active through sports. I believe in living a balanced life where learning, creativity, and fun go hand in hand.

Feel free to connect with me or explore my work. Thanks for visiting!
